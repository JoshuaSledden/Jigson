The package fmt provides CMake targets:

    find_package(fmt CONFIG REQUIRED)
    target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE fmt::fmt)

    # Or use the header-only version
    find_package(fmt CONFIG REQUIRED)
    target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE fmt::fmt-header-only)

The package nlohmann-json provides CMake targets:

    find_package(nlohmann_json CONFIG REQUIRED)
    target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE nlohmann_json::nlohmann_json)

The package nlohmann-json can be configured to not provide implicit conversions via a custom triplet file:
